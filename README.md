# Hello everyone! I'm Ashley Bulseco (_she / her_) 
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm currently a postdoc at the University of New Hampshire researching coastal microbial ecology and biogeochemistry. The README stats cards were created by \@[anuraghazra](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats#readme).
