# Hello everyone! I'm Ashley Bulseco (_she / her_) 
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm currently a postdoc at the University of New Hampshire. I research marine, estuarine, and wetland microbial ecology, with a particular focus on how these systems respond to human-driven environmental change. Microbes are the main drivers of biogeochemical cycling, thus my research often aims to understand carbon and nitrogen cycling through a microbial lens. My work takes a multi-faceted approach applying a range of interdisciplinary techniques: I combine in situ field work, controlled laboratory experiments, biogeochemical measurements, next-generation sequencing, and bioinformatics to answer questions about these complex systems. You can read more about my work on my website ([ashley.bulseco.org](https://ashley.bulseco.org)) or follow me on Twitter @AshleyBulseco.
